# Using No Code techniques to create programs with Delphi

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

This project contains samples for those talks :

- [Coder sans coder : Delphi en mode no code](https://serialstreameur.fr/webinaire-20210930.php) on September 30, 2021 available in French

- [Using Delphi as a No Code Development IDE](https://serialstreameur.fr/delphicon-2021-delphi-nocode.php) on November 13, 2021 available in English

As you will see we can create a lot of projects on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android with Delphi with no programing knowledge. Copy&paste, drag&drop, filling properties, using automatic links or Live Bindings and it's okay for simple database applications.

This code repository contains projects developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).
